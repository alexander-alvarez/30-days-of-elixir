# TASK: Using ExUnit write your first set of tests.
# - Assert that 1 + 1 = 2
# - How do you assert 1 + 1 =/= 3 ?
# - How do you assert an exeception occurs when calling a function? How could you use atoms in this case?
# - Compare two floats are "close enough" using an expected `delta`. E.g. 4.0001 and 4.00
