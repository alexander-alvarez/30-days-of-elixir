# TASK: Create an interactive program that reads from STDIN.
# - Ask the user: "What is your name?"
# - Ask the user: "Do you like cows? [y|n]"
#   - If the user responds 'y' or 'Y', read the cow from `cow.txt` and print it to the console.
#       -  In an error occurs in reading the file, print "Error: cow.txt file not found" to the console.
#   - If the user responds 'n' or 'N', print "That's a shame" followed by the user's name to the console.
#   - Any other input, print "You should have entered 'y' or 'n'." to the console.
#
# BONUS:
#   - Write a test case leveraging module you wrote to that asserts the first non-whitespace character of the cow
#      ASCII art is '('
